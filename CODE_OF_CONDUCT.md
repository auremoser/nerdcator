# Participation Guidelines

This project, participated in the Mozilla Festival, and respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, vendors, and anyone else involved in making the MozFest possible. Since the Nerdcator Project debuted at Mozfest 2016, it seems appropriate to add these guidelines to our repo to maintain the tenor or our interactions on Github.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

The Mozilla Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

Mozilla-based activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

## Raising Issues

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices in your contributions to this project which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact one of the organizers, Aurelia Moser for example (@auremoser on Github).

Nerdcator organisers reserve the right to refuse PRs/submissions/suggestions/contribution rights to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the project.

## Working in the Open

Because working open is one of our core values, project planning is done in the open on Github (check out our repo [here](https://github.com/auremoser/nerdcator)). We hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration and will continue to work with an open ethos in their  ownprojects.
